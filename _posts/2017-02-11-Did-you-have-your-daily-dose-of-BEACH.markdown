 All my life I lived near coastlines. Beaches are an integral part of my life. In a way we humans and beaches are alike .They have the saltiness of our childhood mischiefs. Ever-changing waves represent our ever-changing moods.  The sound of the waves breaking and slowly cascading down as the sand is slowly drawn back by the lapping of the surf delineate incessant mind chatter and constant battle between our logical mind and our ever so romantic heart..And we all know our brain has to lose. High tides during full moon portrays our desire to love and to be loved in return our attraction towards the unattainable and tides teaches us not to give up on our dreams no matter how difficult they are.<br><br>
 
Today while looking at my old photo album I stumbled upon an old picture taken when I first visited Malpe beach with my Mom and Dad when I was 3 years old. It was taken by my dad. In it I am hiding behind my mom holding her saree as the gigantic waves are approaching towards us and my mom explaining me don’t be afraid Rashu waves are our best friends.<br>

Malpe beach has a special place in my heart. Every summer vacation when I visited Karnataka. Me and my cousins used to meet in malpe beach. When we were small we used to building sand castles, eat ice-cream and playing carelessly in the water. When we grow older, we still building sandcastles, eating ice-cream and playing in water. Something’s in life never change. Thank god.!!<br><br>
